  Example Usage
  By ID
  
  data "workos_connection" "example" {
    id = "conn_01HXYZ..."
  }
  
  By Organization and Type

# workos_connection (Data Source)

Use this data source to get information about a WorkOS SSO Connection.

You can look up a connection by its ID, or by organization ID and connection type.

## Example Usage

### By ID

```hcl
data "workos_connection" "example" {
  id = "conn_01HXYZ..."
}
```

### By Organization and Type

```hcl
data "workos_connection" "okta" {
  organization_id = workos_organization.main.id
  connection_type = "OktaSAML"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Look up an existing SSO connection

# Look up by connection ID
data "workos_connection" "by_id" {
  id = "conn_01HXYZ..."
}

output "connection_name_by_id" {
  value = data.workos_connection.by_id.name
}

# Look up by organization and connection type
data "workos_connection" "by_org_type" {
  organization_id = "org_01HXYZ..."
  connection_type = "OktaSAML"
}

output "connection_state" {
  value = data.workos_connection.by_org_type.state
}
```
