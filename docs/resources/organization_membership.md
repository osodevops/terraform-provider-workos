  user_id         = workos_user.example.id
  organization_id = workos_organization.example.id
}
```

### Membership with Role

```hcl
resource "workos_organization_membership" "admin" {
  user_id         = workos_user.admin.id
  organization_id = workos_organization.example.id
  role_slug       = "admin"
}
```
