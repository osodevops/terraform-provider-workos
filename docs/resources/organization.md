  name    = "Acme Corporation"
  domains = ["acme.com", "acmecorp.com"]

  allow_profiles_outside_organization = false
}
```

## Import

Organizations can be imported using the organization ID:

```shell
terraform import workos_organization.example org_01HXYZ...
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Manage a WorkOS Organization
resource "workos_organization" "example" {
  name    = "Acme Corporation"
  domains = ["acme.com", "acmecorp.com"]

  allow_profiles_outside_organization = false
}

# Output the organization ID for use in other resources
output "organization_id" {
  value = workos_organization.example.id
}

output "organization_created_at" {
  value = workos_organization.example.created_at
}
