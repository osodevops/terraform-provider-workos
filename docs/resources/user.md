  via various methods (password, magic link, SSO, OAuth) and be members of
  one or more organizations.
  Example Usage
  Basic User
  
  resource "workos_user" "example" {
    email          = "user@example.com"

    last_name      = "Smith"
    password       = var.user_password
    email_verified = true

  Import
  Users can be imported using the user ID:

# workos_user (Resource)

Manages a WorkOS AuthKit User.

Users are the core identity entity in WorkOS AuthKit. They can authenticate
via various methods (password, magic link, SSO, OAuth) and be members of
one or more organizations.

## Example Usage

### Basic User

```hcl
resource "workos_user" "example" {
  email          = "user@example.com"
  first_name     = "John"
  last_name      = "Doe"
  email_verified = true
}
```

### User with Password

```hcl
resource "workos_user" "with_password" {
  email          = "user@example.com"
  first_name     = "Jane"
  last_name      = "Smith"
  password       = var.user_password
  email_verified = true
}
```

## Import

Users can be imported using the user ID:

```shell
terraform import workos_user.example user_01HXYZ...
```

**Note:** The password cannot be imported and must be set in configuration
if password authentication is required.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic user with email verification
resource "workos_user" "basic" {
  email          = "user@example.com"
  first_name     = "John"
  last_name      = "Doe"
  email_verified = true
}

# User with password authentication
resource "workos_user" "with_password" {
  email          = "jane@example.com"
  first_name     = "Jane"
  last_name      = "Smith"
  password       = var.user_password
  email_verified = true
}

# Minimal user (email only)
resource "workos_user" "minimal" {
  email = "minimal@example.com"
}

# User for SSO-only authentication (no password)
resource "workos_user" "sso_user" {
  email          = "sso-user@example.com"
  first_name     = "SSO"
  last_name      = "User"
  email_verified = true
}

# User with pre-hashed password (for migration)
resource "workos_user" "migrated" {
  email          = "migrated@example.com"
  first_name     = "Migrated"
  last_name      = "User"
  password_hash  = var.bcrypt_password_hash
  email_verified = true
}

# Variables
variable "user_password" {
  type        = string
  description = "Password for the user"
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "bcrypt_password_hash" {
  type        = string
  description = "Pre-hashed bcrypt password for migration"
  sensitive   = true
}

# Outputs
output "user_id" {
  value       = workos_user.basic.id
  description = "The ID of the basic user"
}

output "user_email" {
  value       = workos_user.basic.email
  description = "The email of the basic user"
}
```
